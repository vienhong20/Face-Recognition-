# Face-Recognition-

My goal is to have photo of everybody in UM Coding Bootcamp class and their name in the database to help me regconitive and remember when i see them again.

the app pretty simple and straightforward, input the picture and it will tell you the name of every person if its about 60% matching with the database. The person who left out would assign with "unknow".

Made with ❤️
